Gravity Well Readme
Zakary Olyarnik, Mark Takakjy
February 2017

INTRODUCTION:
Twin black holes have erupted just outside your space station!
Try to avoid them for as long as possible!
Collect Moon Rocks when gravity is up!  Collect Rocket Fuel Canisters when gravity is down!
Shoot the Switches to switch the Blast Doors!  Avoid Alien attacks!
Use A/D or arrow keys to move and space to shoot.


RUNNING THE GAME:
We have provided a Windows build (GravityWell.exe) and a WebGL build (index.html), both located in the Builds
subfolder, and both tested for validity.  The Windows build must be run with 1920x1080 resolution to display as
intended, due to the unpredictable way Unity's UI scales to different resolutions.  The web build is also set to
1920x1280, but should be run in fullscreen to properly display this way.

CHANGES SINCE BETA:
-Updated sprites including run, hover, and fall animations for the player character
-The addition of sounds
-The addition of a second black hole and the door-switching mechanic
-Gravity and player mass are now represented as status bars on either side of the screen, so players worry less about the actual numbers
-Collectibles now interact with the other objects in the level rather than just phasing through them
